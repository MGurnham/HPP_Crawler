For a household of two people, the limit is $16,684 annually, or about $1,390 per month.\n\nIt's worth noting that these limits are based on gross income and do not take into account deductions such as taxes, Social Security payments, or other expenses. Additionally, some states have higher or lower income eligibility limits than the federal poverty level.\n\nTo determine your specific income eligibility for SNAP benefits, you can contact your state's social services office or visit their website to find out more information."

However, it does mention that the program is available to at-risk, low-income households that are currently ineligible for Homebase, which suggests that there may be income eligibility requirements for some of the program's services.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Community Roots program, which is mentioned in the article as an alternative to Homebase for at-risk tenants who are ineligible for Homebase, does have income eligibility requirements. According to the article, the program is available to households with incomes below 50% of the area median income (AMI). However, it's important to note that not all services provided through Homebase may have the same income eligibility requirements as Community Roots."
