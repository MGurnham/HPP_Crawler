To be eligible for Ontario Works, you must meet certain income and financial requirements, which may include:\n\n1. Income limits: Your income must be below a certain level to qualify for assistance. The exact income limits vary depending on the size of your household and your circumstances, but generally, if you are single, your income cannot exceed $25,000 per year, and if you are part of a family, your income cannot exceed $45,000 per year.\n2. Financial need: You must demonstrate a financial need for assistance. This means that you must be unable to meet your basic needs without help. The program will consider factors such as your income, expenses, and assets when determining your level of financial need.\n3. Residency requirements: You must live in Ontario to qualify for Ontario Works.\n4. Health and social issues: You may also be required to provide information about any health or social issues that may affect your ability to work or access other forms of assistance.\n\nIt's important to note that these income limits are subject to change and may vary depending on the specific program and location.

For a household of two people, the limit is $16,684 annually, or about $1,390 per month.\n\nIt's worth noting that these limits are based on gross income and do not take into account deductions such as taxes, Social Security payments, or other expenses. Additionally, some states have higher or lower income eligibility limits than the federal poverty level.\n\nTo determine your specific income eligibility for SNAP benefits, you can contact your state's social services office or visit their website to find out more information."

        "tables": "Question\tAnswer\nWhat is an Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV)?\tThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a limited number of Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs) to our PHA, New York State Homes and Community Renewal (NYSHCR). EHVs are tenant-based rental assistance under Section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) and will generally operate like tenant-based Section 8.EHV assistance is limited to families and individuals who are:Homeless;At-risk of homelessness;Fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking; orRecently homeless and for whom providing rental assistance will prevent the family’s homelessness or having high risk of housing instability.Potentially eligible families and individuals must first complete an initial screening with their local Continuum-of-Care (CoC) and be referred to NYSHCR. Clients cannot apply on their own.\nWhat is a Continuum of Care?\tThe Continuum of Care (CoC) is a local planning body that coordinates housing and services funding for homeless individuals and families. The CoC Program is designed to:promote community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness;provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers and State and local governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals and families and minimize the trauma and dislocation that homelessness causes for individuals, families, and communities;promote access to and effect utilization of mainstream programs by homeless individuals and families; andoptimize self-sufficiency among individuals and families experiencing homelessness.Section 9.b of HUD Notice PIH 2021-15 provides a more thorough description of CoCs and their role in the EHV program. Additional information on CoC’s can be found athttps://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/coc\nWhat is a Victims Service Provider?\tHUD defines a victim service provider to mean a private nonprofit organization whose primary mission is to provide direct services to victims of domestic violence. This term includes permanent housing providers—including rapid re-housing, domestic violence programs (shelters and non-residential), domestic violence transitional housing programs, dual domestic violence and sexual assault programs, and related advocacy and supportive services programs.\nWhat is a Coordinated Entry system?\tProvisions in the CoC Program Interim Rule at 24 CFR § 578.7(a)(8) require that CoCs establish a Coordinated Entry (CE) System. The Coordinated Entry (CE) process is an approach to coordination and management of a crisis response system’s resources that allows users to make consistent decisions, based on available information, to efficiently and effectively connect people to housing and service interventions that will rapidly end their homelessness.\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities of PHAs, CoCs, and Victim Service Providers (VSPs)?\tCoCs and VSPs are responsible for the following:Assessing eligible households for EHV and services (if needed).Referring eligible households to the Public Housing Authority (PHA) for EHV.CoCs may additionally assist referred households in completing and obtaining necessary documentation for the EHV application process.PHAs are responsible for all the PHA administrative responsibilities for the EHV program in accordance with the EHV Operating Requirements Notice and the applicable HCV program regulations, including but not limited to:Reviewing applications for EHV, certifying program eligibility, and conducting annual recertifications for continued eligibilityDetermining that the unit meets Housing Quality Standards and approving units for leasing and contractsDetermining amounts and paying Housing Assistance Payments to landlords on behalf of participantsExplaining and providing information about program policies and procedures to current and prospective landlords and participantsMonitoring program performance and compliance of participants and owners\nAre participants in Rapid Rehousing programs eligible for EHV?\tYes. CoCs have the discretion to refer households in Rapid Rehousing programs.\nAre the vouchers available for individuals or just for families?\tEHVs are available to both individuals and families meeting the eligibility criteria.\nWhat if an individual or family is over income?\tAs in the regular voucher program, the PHA must determine whether a family is income eligible prior to the provision of EHV assistance. If the family is over income based on the most recently published income limits for the family size, the family is ineligible for HCV assistance.\nAre there any restrictions on families who may owe debts to a PHA?\tNo, as outlined in HUD Notice 2021-15, Section 9g., unlike regular HCV admissions, PHAs may not deny an EHV applicant admission regardless of whether:Any member of the family has been evicted from federally assisted housing in the last five years or a PHA has ever terminated assistance under the program for any member of the family. · The family currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.The family has not reimbursed any PHA for amounts paid to an owner under a HAP contract for rent, damages to the unit, or other amounts owed by the family under the lease.The family breached an agreement with the PHA to pay amounts owed to a PHA or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. EHV funding may not be used for the repayment of debts or any amounts owed to HUD by HUD program participants including, but not limited to, those resulting from Office of Inspector General (OIG), Quality Assurance Division (QAD) or other monitoring review findings.\nMy local CoC has referred me to your EHV program. What’s next?\tReferrals will be drawn in order. Applicants will be sent eligibility packets via email. Required forms included in the Eligibility packet will need to be completed and submitted back together with verification of all household members’ information, including birth certificates, social security cards, Alien Registration Card (if any), current government issued photo ID, all income information (e.g., public assistance benefit letter, SSI statement, child support, current checking account statement, current paystubs), proof of fulltime student status (if applicable), and asset information. Your CoC can help with gathering and uploading the required documents to the online portal provided with your eligibility packet notice.\nWhat happens after my eligibility packet is submitted?\tYour eligibility application packet will be reviewed for completeness and program eligibility.Program eligibility includes:income eligibility;eligible immigration status (at least one family member must have an eligible immigration status);standards for admission (HUD does not permit anyone with a lifetime sex offender registration requirement or a person convicted of drug-related criminal activity for the manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing to receive EHV assistance); andthe submission of required documentation. If additional information or documentation is needed, then a Case Manager will contact you. If you are determined eligible for the EHV program, you will need to attend an eligibility interview and voucher briefing. After the briefing, you will be issued a voucher and leasing/landlord package via email or mail.\nWhat if my application for EHV assistance is denied?\tIf your application is denied, you will receive written notice of the denial and have the opportunity to request an informal review (not a hearing).\nI have received an Emergency Housing Voucher. What do I do now?\tOnce you receive an EHV, you must find an apartment to rent and submit a completed leasing package to your assigned Case Manager before the expiration of your voucher. Your CoC can help connect you with EHV housing search assistance. Please work closely with them as they may have access to resources dedicated to the housing search. Please make best efforts to attend all appointments and apartment viewings.\nHow does EHV help me pay rent?\tIf you lease up in a unit with an EHV, your household will typically pay 30% of your household income toward rent, and NYSHCR will pay the difference. As the voucher holder, you will pay your portion of the rent directly to the owner. NYSHCR will pay their portion of the rent directly to the owner as well.\nDoes my EHV expire?\tThe term of the voucher is listed on the first page of the voucher. If you do not submit a completed leasing packet before the voucher expiration date, the voucher will expire, and you will not receive rental assistance. For NYSHCR EHVs, your initial voucher term will be180 days. Additional extensions, beyond 180 days, will only be considered for Reasonable Accommodation requests. You must request your extension, if needed, before your voucher expiration date by contacting your assigned Case Manager, given on your eligibility notice.\nWill I be eligible for assistance with a security deposit or moving expenses?\tEHV voucher holders may be eligible to receive security deposit and moving expense assistance. Your Case Manager can provide more details and guide you through the next steps.\nI found an apartment, what are the next steps?\tYou and the owner of the apartment must complete the leasing package and submit it to your assigned Case Manager administering your voucher. We will review the leasing packet for completeness and must determine that the rent charged is reasonable and that the owner is eligible to rent the unit. We will also determine whether the apartment meets federal Housing Quality Standards (HQS).A physical inspection of the unit will be done.If the rent is reasonable and the unit is otherwise eligible to receive EHV assistance, then we will approve the rental.\nWhat is a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract?\tThis is the agreement between the PHA (NYSHCR) and the owner of the apartment, in order for us to make monthly subsidy payments on your behalf to the owner. We will provide the HAP contract to the owner in the final stage of the rental process. The owner must sign and return the HAP contract to us with a fully executed lease.\nWhen can I move into my new unit?\tEHV applicants may move into their new apartment as of the start date of the HAP contract, which is listed on the initial Approval/Move-in letter.\nCan I move and still be assisted with my EHV voucher?\tYes. You may be eligible to move if you have complied with EHV program requirements. If you require an emergency transfer, please contact your assigned Case Manager to find out more about the emergency transfer process.\nCan I move out of NYC with my EHV voucher?\tYes. Moving outside the New York City area is called portability. EHV voucher holders have the opportunity to live anywhere in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands as long as there is a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program administered in that area. You will need to submit a request and provide the name and contact information of the PHA you would like to transfer your voucher (port) to; if you need assistance in locating this information your administering agency can assist. Please contact your assigned PHA Case Manager to find out additional information on how to port-out with your EHV. Note: The housing search assistance services offered by the receiving housing authority may be different than the housing search assistance services offered by NYSHCR to EHV holders."

However, these details are not provided in the article. If you have questions about specific income eligibility limits for programs offered by the Illinois Department of Human Services, I recommend contacting their office directly.",

Depending on the program, type of payment, and source of funding, these payments can be used for both private market and community housing units.Rent Supplement ProgramEligible households pay a portion of the rent according to an income formula and the landlord receives a supplement for the remainder of the rental cost.

In general, the program is designed to assist low-income individuals and families who are struggling to pay for basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare. The exact income eligibility limits will depend on the specific program and location, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Medicaid: In most states, Medicaid is available to individuals with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). For a family of four, this means an income of approximately $34,000 or less.\n* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): SNAP is available to individuals and families with incomes below 130% of the FPL. For a family of four, this means an income of approximately $27,000 or less.\n* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): TANF is available to families with incomes below 50% of the FPL. For a family of four, this means an income of approximately $12,000 or less.\n* Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program: This program is available to individuals and families with incomes below 50% of the FPL. For a family of four, this means an income of approximately $12,000 or less.\n\nIt's important to note that these are general guidelines, and the exact income eligibility limits may vary depending on the specific program and location. Additionally, some programs may have other eligibility requirements, such as immigration status or disability status.
